Install python libraries
    1) Selenium
    2) Time
    3) csv

Make sure that you have Morzilla Firefox installed on your system.
Download the Selenium web driver for Firefox and add it to the path. This gives the script permission to
run Firefox in the background and check the html scritps for the particular web links.

Put all the links in a 'Links.csv' separated by ',' on a different line. Make sure that the first line is
"Links", and the youtube links start from the secound line.

The script will create a new csv, "Data.csv" if already not there. It will contain all the information
needed.
